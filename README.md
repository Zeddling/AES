# Advanced Encryption Standard(AES)

AES is a variant of the Rjindael block cipher.
It's a symmetric key algorithm.
It uses the [substitution-permutation network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution%E2%80%93permutation_network) design principle which is a series of linked mathematical operations.

AES has a fixed block size of 128 bits and a key size of 128, 192 or 256 bits.
